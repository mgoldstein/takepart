            <p class='form-blurb'>Three people will be selected to become an Intel for Changemaker. Along with a film crew, each Changemaker will be sent to one of three countries to spend two weeks volunteering, making a real difference on the ground. A web series will be produced featuring each Changemaker and their experience abroad. The Changemakers will become a voice for girls’ education, raising awareness and funds for this issue.</p>
